# FlutterNewsApp

My second attempt at making a flutter application. This application helped me learn a lot about axis alignment, widgets, cached network image, making models and also gave an idea of design of various components and also helped me gain more in-depth knowledge about dart.

Here are a few screenshots from my FlutterNews App

The top bar has the various categories covered by a newspaper (app :P)
